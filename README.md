# Saml_Django_Face_Recognition
In this project, I developed a face recognition app using the django framework and SAML for user authentication. I used the open source python3-saml library for SAML authentication integration and the Django Authentication Framework for authorization of subsequent requests. The python face-recognition library was used for face recognition with a 99.38% accuracy. For Identity Provider, I used MS Azure AD. The django application has two apps (corresponding to two service providers). One simply displays user information while the other does face recognition.
Once the user logs in (I used https://localhost:8000/ endpoint for development purposes), a webcam access is requested. Once allowed, webcam is shown on screen while a snapshot data (base64) is sent to server every 3 seconds to perform face recognition. After the server side processes the data, a response is sent back to the client with a name identifier or an Unknown if nothing is identified.
